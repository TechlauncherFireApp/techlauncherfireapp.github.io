Developed since 2019 by Australian National University students, FireApp is an innovative application that harnesses the power of AI to efficiently schedule and oversee volunteer firefighters. FireApp stemmed from the devastating black summer bushfires that occurred in Australia between 2019 and 2020, which highlighted the necessity of enhancing emergency response capabilities in view of the growing dependence on these critical services. FireApp is the result of a collaborative effort between the students and Accenture.
